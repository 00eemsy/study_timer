## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª DESCRIPTION

Welcome to `study_timer ‚è≤Ô∏è`, my take on a clean and visually-appealing study timer. `study_timer ‚è≤Ô∏è` was born out of my desire for a beautiful study timer that actually worked. Something not too frilly, but customizable enough to make every study session a bit more fun!

This web app is React.js-based with CSS for stylizations. I also employ the [**Reactjs-popup**](https://github.com/yjose/reactjs-popup) library for popup functionality, with an SVG from [**iconmonstr**](https://iconmonstr.com/pencil-14-svg/ ).
